[Barnes (2010)](https://www.nature.com/articles/467753a) 

*My code is not good enough* “if your code is good enough to do the job, then it is good enough to release—and releasing it will help your research and your field.”

*People will demand support and bug fixes*. "Publishing code may see you accused of sloppiness. Not publishing can draw allegations of fraud. Which is worse? Nobody is entitled to demand technical support for freely provided code..."

*It is too much work*. "For scientists, the word publication is totemic, and signifies perfectionism. But...the original code can be published as supplementary information, available from an institutional or journal website."
